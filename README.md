# Python-Pin-Payments Library

## Overview

The Python-Pin-Payments library is a comprehensive tool designed to interact with the Pin Payments API. It simplifies the process of handling payment operations, including charges, customer management, and refunds. This library encompasses several modules:

- **ChargesAPI**: For creating and managing payment card charges.
- **CustomersAPI**: To store and manage customer information and their payment details.
- **RefundsAPI**: Allows refunding charges and retrieving details of previous refunds.

## Installation using Poetry

Poetry is a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python. To set up and use the Python-Pin-Payments library with Poetry:

### Install Poetry

If Poetry is not already installed, follow the instructions on the [Poetry website](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

### Create and Configure a New Project

If starting a new project:

```bash
poetry new python-pin-payments-project
cd python-pin-payments-project
```

### Activate the Virtual Environment

Activate the virtual environment created by Poetry:

```bash
poetry shell
```

### Add Python-Pin-Payments Library

Add the library as a dependency:

- If published on PyPI:

```bash
poetry add python-pin-payments
```

- For a local or git version:

```bash
poetry add git+https://gitlab.onix.ua/onix-systems/python-pin-payments.git#master
```

### Install Dependencies

Install all necessary dependencies:

```bash
poetry install
```

## Configuration and Initialization

### Configuration

Before using the Refunds API, you must configure it with your API key:

```python
from pin_payments import RefundsAPI

api_key = "your-api-key"
refunds_api = RefundsAPI(api_key=api_key)
```

### Initialization

Instantiate the RefundsAPI class with your secret API key:

```python
refunds_api = RefundsAPI(api_key="your-secret-api-key")
```

## API Usage - Retrieving and Creating Refunds

### Retrieve All Refunds

To get a paginated list of all refunds:

```python
all_refunds = refunds_api.get_refunds()
```

### Retrieve a Specific Refund

Fetch details of a particular refund using its token:

```python
refund_details = refunds_api.get_refunds_refund_token(refund_token="rf_123456789")
```

### Issue a Refund

Create a new refund on a specific charge:

```python
new_refund = refunds_api.post_charges_charge_token_refunds(
    charge_token="ch_123456789",
    amount=5000  # Refund amount in the smallest currency unit (e.g., cents for AUD)
)
```

### Retrieve Refunds for a Specific Charge

List all refunds made for a specific charge:

```python
charge_refunds = refunds_api.get_charges_charge_token_refunds(charge_token="ch_123456789")
```

## Error Handling and Logging

### Error Handling

The library will return detailed error messages in case of failure. Ensure to handle these errors gracefully in your code:

```python
response = refunds_api.get_refunds()
if 'error' in response:
    logging.error(f"Refund retrieval failed with error: {response['error']}")
else:
    # Process successful response
```

### Logging

Logging is crucial for monitoring API interactions. Set up logging at the beginning of your application:

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
```

## Development and Testing
